# Abstract 

Here, I reexamine the analysis of Oeppen and Vaupel (2002). 

# Analysis 

Here, we create a data frame that contains only the maximum life expectancy and the corresponding country for each year in the gapminder_unfiltered data set. 

```{r}
gapminder_unfiltered |>
  group_by(year) |>
  filter(lifeExp == max(lifeExp)) |>
  ungroup() |>
  select(year, country, lifeExp) |>
  arrange(year) -> sumdat
```

I pushed to github; testing and making change. 

Making one more change as a test.
